# Konkourix Read-Only UI Audit

**Status:** Current implementation audit; documentation only
**Audit date:** 2026-09-17
**Implementation baseline:** M19 (`76bc4d7`) plus the current working tree
**Compared against:** [UX_ARCHITECTURE.md](UX_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [PRODUCT_VISION.md](PRODUCT_VISION.md)

This report statically audits `apps/student-web` and `apps/counselor-web`. It does not modify or execute either application. Findings are based on route composition, page/component source, forms, CSS, and responsive rules. Runtime visual regression, real-device testing, assistive-technology testing, performance measurement, and browser compatibility testing were not performed.

## Classification

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Keep** | Correct domain/interaction foundation that can remain with limited polish |
| **Modify** | Useful implementation exists, but information architecture, behavior, semantics, or styling must evolve |
| **Replace** | Current surface embodies a transitional or conflicting model; preserve required data/history but replace the experience |
| **New requirement** | Required by target UX but no implemented surface exists |

A classification applies to the user experience, not permission to delete underlying code or data. In particular, replacing legacy subject/topic or assessment UI must preserve historical access as required by the architecture.

## Executive Summary

| Area | Current assessment | Primary classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student routes | Real Planning, Study, Assessment, Settings; placeholder Dashboard/Reports | **Modify** |
| Counselor routes | Real student list/detail/task tools; placeholder Dashboard/Planning/Reports | **Modify** |
| Dashboards | Visually structured but intentionally data-free placeholders | **Replace** |
| Planning | Good M19 Task/Study Session separation; no versioned counselor plans | **Replace** at aggregate level, **Keep/Modify** execution patterns |
| Curriculum | Student-created subjects/topics conflict with canonical read-only curriculum | **Replace** |
| Assessment | Generic completed-attempt entry conflicts with three target domains | **Replace**, retain legacy history |
| Components | Small semantic foundation duplicated across both apps | **Modify** |
| Design system | RTL, focus, dark mode, reduced motion, 44px controls exist; tokens diverge | **Modify** |
| Responsive behavior | Functional breakpoints, safe-area bottom nav, and non-drag weekly movement exist | **Keep/Modify** |
| Target capabilities | Progress, Daily Reality, published plans, Practice, exams, communication, admin workflows absent | **New requirement** |

The strongest reusable implementation is the separation between a Task and its Study Sessions. The largest mismatch is the current user-owned subject/topic and direct counselor-task workflow, which cannot become the target Curriculum and versioned Plan model through cosmetic changes alone.

## 1. Student Web Routes

Source: `apps/student-web/src/App.tsx` and `apps/student-web/src/routing/useBrowserRouter.ts`.

### Implemented Route Inventory

| Route | Current page/behavior | Classification | Target disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/login` | Persian RTL login with separate student branding, safe auth error, username/password autocomplete | **Keep** | Retain the role-specific entry; align visual tokens, add full accessible-authentication review, and preserve recovery states |
| `/` | Placeholder dashboard with empty summary cards and disabled actions | **Replace** | Become target `Today`: active session/attempt recovery, next action, today timeline, follow-up, and recent evidence |
| `/planning` | Real daily Task list, personal Task form, filters, status changes, rescheduling, live Study Session recovery/start/finish/cancel, session history/feedback | **Modify** | Reframe as Today/Plan execution surface; keep session recovery and explicit Task provenance while replacing checkbox-like result actions with Task Result workflow |
| `/planning/weekly` | Real week grid, workload summary, personal Task movement by drag or explicit destination buttons, execution-aware locks | **Modify** | Keep week/list patterns and non-drag alternative; add published Plan version/source, reality context, history, and target navigation |
| `/study` | Student creates, renames, archives, and restores personal `StudySubject`/`Topic` data | **Replace** | Read-only Canonical Curriculum Explorer with Progress overlay; retain legacy data in a clearly labelled historical compatibility surface |
| `/assessments` | Generic completed `AssessmentAttempt` form/history with Task, subject/topic, timestamps, counts, invalidation | **Replace** | Become `Practice & Exams` with distinct Practice, External Report, Internal Exam, and legacy-assessment histories; do not reclassify old attempts automatically |
| `/reports` | Placeholder | **Replace** | Move target reporting under Progress/learning timeline and later Analytics; do not keep a generic empty top-level report page |
| `/settings` | Real student profile, theme, password, current/all-session logout | **Keep** | Retain under `More`; modify to target shell/tokens and expanded preference/privacy needs when approved |
| Unknown path | Localized not-found state with return action | **Keep** | Retain within the target router and shell |

### Student Route Architecture Findings

- **Modify:** Routing is a custom exact-path browser-history hook. It correctly supports `popstate`, push/replace, and scroll reset, but target nested workspaces, route state, deep links, protected subroutes, and exam recovery need a more explicit route model.
- **Modify:** Desktop and mobile use the same six-item navigation array. Target mobile navigation has five primary destinations and moves settings/reality/counselor/profile to `More`.
- **Replace:** `Dashboard`, `Study`, `Assessments`, and `Reports` labels encode the M19 shape, not target `Today`, `Plan`, `Progress`, `Practice & Exams`, and `Messages` information architecture.
- **New requirement:** Routes/surfaces for Progress, Daily Reality Schedule, Messages, Tickets, Suggestions, counselor relationship, Plan history, and distinct assessment domains do not exist.
- **Keep:** Role separation is explicit: Student Web does not expose Counselor navigation or student-switching controls.

## 2. Counselor Web Routes

Source: `apps/counselor-web/src/App.tsx` and `apps/counselor-web/src/routing/useBrowserRouter.ts`.

### Implemented Route Inventory

| Route | Current page/behavior | Classification | Target disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/login` | Persian RTL counselor login with distinct branding and role-aware copy | **Keep** | Retain; align shared tokens and accessible-authentication behavior |
| `/` | Placeholder counselor dashboard with empty summary cards and disabled actions | **Replace** | Become target Overview with attention queue, planning queue, unread communication, and recent evidence |
| `/students` | Real paginated assigned-student cards with status, education level, school, and detail navigation | **Modify** | Keep authorized list foundation; add search/filter/attention context and target student workspace entry |
| `/students/:uuid` | Real student profile followed by weekly Task view, Task list, batch Task form, and single Task form in one long page | **Replace** | Become persistent student workspace with Overview, Reality, Plans, Execution, Progress, Assessments, Communication, and protected Private Notes tabs |
| `/planning` | Placeholder | **Replace** | Become counselor Draft/Published/Revision queue and paper-speed planning workspace |
| `/reports` | Placeholder | **Replace** | Become source-preserving evidence/reporting views after Analytics phase; avoid a generic report shell before data exists |
| `/settings` | Real counselor profile, theme, password, and session controls | **Keep** | Retain under `More`; align design system and future privacy/security needs |
| Unknown path | Localized not-found state | **Keep** | Retain within target route architecture |

### Counselor Route Architecture Findings

- **Keep:** Detail routing rejects arbitrary IDs and only recognizes UUID-shaped student routes before the API enforces actual authorization.
- **Modify:** The same custom route hook limitations identified in Student Web apply here; student-workspace tabs, planning versions, inbox routes, and admin-like review contexts require explicit nested routing.
- **Replace:** The `StudentDetailPage` stacks all current capabilities linearly. It lacks persistent student context beyond the page header and cannot scale to the target multi-domain workspace.
- **New requirement:** Inbox, Curriculum Explorer, Suggestions, private notes, Plan drafts/publications, Progress, Practice/Exam evidence, and counselor-request/introduction routes do not exist.
- **Keep:** Student list/detail loading, empty, unauthorized/not-found, pagination, and retry states are useful foundations.

## 3. Existing Pages

### Student Pages

| Page | Evidence and current strengths | Classification | Required change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DashboardPage` | Greeting, summary grid, two dashboard regions, explicit placeholders | **Replace** | Use real Today priority ordering; remove milestone/developer copy and disabled fake actions |
| `TodayPlanningPage` | Mature M19 workflow: filtering, pagination, personal Task creation, Task source labels, guarded rescheduling, active-session recovery, switch/cancel consequences, explicit Study/Task separation | **Modify** | Preserve execution/recovery patterns; add published-plan context and canonical selection; replace status buttons with Task Result; remove inline legacy-subject creation |
| `WeeklyPlanningPage` | Saturday–Friday week, workload summary, optimistic movement rollback, drag plus accessible click destination, counselor/execution locks | **Modify** | Recast as Plan view; show Plan version and sources; keep personal movement only; add list alternative and Daily Reality overlay where applicable |
| `SubjectTopicsPage` | Functional two-panel subject/topic management with archive/restore, rename, loading/error/empty states | **Replace** | Canonical curriculum is read-only for students; provide Explorer/Progress and separately preserve legacy labels/history |
| `AssessmentAttemptsPage` | Completed-attempt facts, derived total/duration display, invalidation, clear no-score promise | **Replace** | Preserve as `Legacy assessment history`; create separate Practice/External/Internal experiences rather than extending this form |
| `SettingsPage` | Profile, light/dark, password validation, current/all-session controls, loading/error/success | **Keep** | Move under More; replace native confirm; add consistent field/state components and accessibility review |
| `LoginPage` | Branded RTL split layout, explicit student copy, labelled inputs, error state | **Keep** | Align blue-based identity and shared auth design; add recovery/help only when approved |
| `PlaceholderPage` | Consistent empty-state wrapper | **Modify** | Keep only for controlled development; target navigation must not expose unfinished destinations |

### Counselor Pages and Student Workspace Modules

| Page/module | Evidence and current strengths | Classification | Required change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DashboardPage` | Structured placeholder matching current shell | **Replace** | Implement target attention/planning/communication/evidence dashboard; remove milestone copy |
| `StudentsPage` | Paginated authorized list, localized states, student status/facts | **Modify** | Add target filtering/search/context and route into persistent workspace |
| `StudentDetailPage` | Fetches authorized student and composes real modules | **Replace** | Replace long vertical composition with tabbed/contextual student workspace; retain profile facts as Overview content |
| `StudentWeeklyPlanning` | Read-only week distribution with workload totals and source/status labels | **Modify** | Use published Plan Versions plus Daily Reality overlay; retain current legacy Task view as compatibility history |
| `StudentTaskList` | Shows source, execution minutes/session count, active session, assessment presence, lock reason, guarded counselor rescheduling | **Modify** | Preserve source/evidence visibility; move into Execution/legacy Tasks and replace direct rescheduling with Plan revision semantics for target counselor plans |
| `StudentTaskForm` | Real single counselor Task creation with student-owned subject/topic selection | **Replace** | Target counselor work is authored inside Draft Plan Items and published atomically; direct legacy Task creation remains compatibility-only until cutover |
| `StudentBatchTaskForm` | Efficient multi-row creation, planned minutes/tests, up to 50 rows | **Replace** | Reuse paper-speed multi-entry interaction ideas inside a versioned Plan draft; do not retain direct batch publication as independent Tasks |
| `SettingsPage` | Profile/security/theme workflow equivalent to Student Web | **Keep** | Align shared system and move under More |
| `LoginPage` | Distinct counselor copy/branding | **Keep** | Preserve role clarity while aligning brand system |
| `PlaceholderPage` | Shared placeholder behavior | **Modify** | Do not expose unfinished Planning/Reports destinations in target releases |

## 4. Components

### Shared-Looking Components Currently Duplicated

`Button`, `Card`, `ContentState`, `NavIcon`, `AppShell`, routing hooks, auth structures, and theme hooks exist separately in both applications with near-identical implementations.

| Component/pattern | Classification | Audit finding and target action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Button` | **Keep** | Semantic native button, variants, disabled state, and 44px minimum are sound. Move toward shared tokens/components and add consistent busy/icon/size/destructive-confirmation patterns without hiding button text. |
| `Card` | **Modify** | Useful surface primitive, but always renders a `<section>` and optional `<h2>`, which may not match every document hierarchy. Make semantics/heading level contextual in the future system. |
| `ContentState` | **Modify** | Strong localized loading/empty/error base with roles and actions. Extend to stale, partial, offline/reconnecting, skeleton, and freshness states; avoid one 220px centered treatment for every context. |
| `NavIcon` | **Modify** | Simple code-native SVG paths and hidden decoration are appropriate. Expand semantic icon coverage and shared ownership; keep labels visible. |
| `AppShell` | **Modify** | RTL sidebar, sticky mobile header, bottom nav, user summary, theme, and main landmark are reusable. Add skip link, target nav, `More`, persistent student/version context, breadcrumbs where needed, and safer responsive context handling. |
| `useBrowserRouter` | **Modify** | Minimal history support works for current routes. Target nested/deep/recovery workflows need explicit route configuration, parameters, state, focus/page-title handling, and navigation guards. |
| `TaskExecutionPanel` | **Keep** | Correctly keeps Study Sessions separate from Task state, supports history/recovery/feedback, and labels focus versus study quality. Modify visual density, component reuse, and target evidence integration. |
| Weekly movement pattern | **Keep** | Drag is supplemented by explicit task selection and destination buttons, and failed optimistic movement rolls back. Reuse for eligible personal Tasks and draft planning, not published counselor content. |
| Student/Counselor status badges | **Modify** | Consistent shape and text exist, but status semantics use page-specific CSS/hard-coded colors. Move to domain/state tokens and never rely on color alone. |
| Native `window.confirm` | **Replace** | Used for topic archive, assessment invalidation, and all-session logout. Replace with accessible, consequence-specific confirmation surfaces that preserve focus and pending state. |

### New Component Requirements

- **New requirement:** Curriculum Tree/List, breadcrumb, node picker, version badge, deprecated/retired state, and Progress overlay.
- **New requirement:** Plan workspace, schedule grid plus list alternative, Reality layer, Plan Item editor, version diff, publication review, and immutable history.
- **New requirement:** Task Result control with Completed/Incomplete/Skipped and labelled five-level learning quality.
- **New requirement:** Practice form/history, External Report evidence/status, and Internal Exam delivery/navigation/result components.
- **New requirement:** Chat, Ticket, Suggestion, unified inbox, and private-note protected surfaces.
- **New requirement:** Admin moderation checklist, attribution/rights panel, import ambiguity queue, audit timeline, and publish confirmation.
- **New requirement:** Accessible dialog/sheet, toast/live feedback policy, stale/partial/offline state, and source/freshness disclosure components.

## 5. Current Navigation

### Student Navigation

Current desktop sidebar and mobile bottom bar contain:

```text
Dashboard | Planning | Study/Subjects | Assessments | Reports | Settings
```

| Finding | Classification | Comparison with target UX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Persistent labelled desktop sidebar | **Keep** | Matches the target role shell pattern and avoids icon-only navigation |
| Fixed mobile bottom navigation with safe-area padding | **Keep** | Correct mobile foundation |
| Six equally weighted mobile destinations | **Replace** | Target has five: Today, Plan, Progress, Practice & Exams, Messages; More holds settings/reality/profile |
| Dashboard as generic home | **Replace** | Target landing destination is Today and prioritizes recovery/next action |
| Study/Subjects destination | **Replace** | Becomes read-only Curriculum/Progress, not student taxonomy administration |
| Assessments destination | **Replace** | Becomes a container with clearly separated Practice, External, Internal, and legacy histories |
| Reports primary destination | **Replace** | Target reporting is contextual under Progress/Analytics rather than an empty generic page |
| Settings primary destination | **Modify** | Move to More while retaining functionality |
| Header page title/description and theme action | **Modify** | Keep orientation; add version/student/context information and avoid hiding necessary context on mobile |
| No skip-to-content link | **New requirement** | Add keyboard bypass navigation before the sidebar/header |
| No Messages destination | **New requirement** | Add Chat/Ticket/Suggestion hub only when implemented |

### Counselor Navigation

Current desktop sidebar and mobile bottom bar contain:

```text
Dashboard | Students | Planning | Reports | Settings
```

| Finding | Classification | Comparison with target UX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Five labelled mobile destinations | **Keep** | Correct capacity and labelled-icon pattern |
| Dashboard | **Modify** | Rename/rebuild as Overview with real queues |
| Students | **Keep** | Remains a primary target destination |
| Planning | **Replace** | Placeholder must become versioned draft/publication workspace |
| Reports | **Replace** | Target primary destination is Inbox; reports live contextually and after Analytics |
| Settings | **Modify** | Move to More; More also hosts Curriculum and Suggestions |
| Student detail route highlighted under Students | **Keep** | Correct high-level selection state; add persistent student context and tabs |
| No Inbox or More | **New requirement** | Required by target counselor IA |
| No breadcrumb/context trail | **New requirement** | Needed for student workspace, Plan Version, Curriculum, and evidence drill-down |

### Admin Navigation

- **New requirement:** No Admin frontend or admin route architecture exists.
- Target administration must be permission-scoped workspaces for Curriculum, Question Bank, Internal Exams, Communication Operations, Counselor Operations, and Security/Audit—not one unrestricted panel.

## 6. Current Dashboards

### Student Dashboard

The root page renders a greeting, three `—` summary cards, an empty Today region, and three disabled quick actions. Copy explicitly says future milestones will connect data.

**Classification: Replace.**

Reasons:

- It does not surface an active Study Session even though session recovery exists on `/planning`.
- It does not show the next Task, today timeline, follow-up, messages, or recent evidence.
- Disabled fake actions expose unfinished capability rather than hiding it.
- Weekly progress is promised before the target Progress/Analytics calculation exists.
- The layout shape—greeting/summary/content regions—can inform the replacement, but the information priority and data semantics must change.

### Counselor Dashboard

The root page mirrors the Student placeholder: three `—` cards, an empty activity card, and disabled actions.

**Classification: Replace.**

The target Overview needs explainable attention and planning queues, unread communication, and recent source-labelled evidence. It must not infer that “no loaded data” means no student needs attention.

### Dashboard New Requirements

- **New requirement:** Active Study Session or Internal Exam recovery takes priority on Student Today.
- **New requirement:** Next published counselor item and personal Task follow-up.
- **New requirement:** Counselor queues distinguish draft, publish, stale/missing context, evidence review, and communication.
- **New requirement:** Every summary links to source records and discloses stale/partial/legacy data.
- **New requirement:** No ranking, streak pressure, AI diagnosis, or unapproved risk labels.

## 7. Forms

### Current Form Quality

**Keep:** Most inputs use visible labels, native controls, `required`/length/number limits, disabled/busy states, localized server-safe errors, and success feedback. Password and login fields have appropriate autocomplete. Forms generally preserve controlled values after ordinary errors.

**Modify:** Error messages are usually standalone `role="alert"` paragraphs and are not consistently connected to individual fields with `aria-describedby`/invalid state. Long forms lack an error summary/focus strategy. Native browser confirmation is used for high-impact actions. Unsaved navigation, duplicate submission semantics, and dynamic-row focus behavior are not consistently expressed.

### Student Forms

| Form | Classification | Audit disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Login | **Keep** | Retain labelled, role-specific authentication; complete accessibility/recovery review |
| Personal Task create | **Modify** | Retain low-friction title/workload/note idea; require canonical selection under target policy and remove inline user-created Subject |
| Inline Subject create | **Replace** | Conflicts directly with controlled Canonical Curriculum |
| Personal Task reschedule | **Keep** | Retain for eligible personal Tasks with evidence locks and explicit target state |
| `Done`/`Skip` Task actions | **Replace** | Use Task Result: Completed/Incomplete/Skipped plus required five-level quality for Completed/Incomplete |
| Study Session start/finish/cancel | **Keep** | Strong separation and consequence messaging; retain server-authoritative recovery |
| Study Session focus/quality feedback | **Keep** | Correctly session-scoped and optional; ensure labels remain distinct from Task Result/mastery |
| Subject create/topic create/rename/archive | **Replace** | Remove from target student authoring; provide canonical read/Progress and legacy history |
| Generic AssessmentAttempt create | **Replace** | Separate Practice, External Report, and Internal Exam; keep old records as legacy history |
| Assessment invalidation | **Modify** | Preserve legacy invalidation, replacing native confirm with audited consequence-specific interaction |
| Student profile/theme/password/sessions | **Keep** | Retain under More; align shared form and confirmation behavior |

### Counselor Forms

| Form | Classification | Audit disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Login | **Keep** | Retain distinct counselor entry |
| Single Task create | **Replace** | Target counselor intention is a Draft Plan Item published atomically, not an immediate standalone Task |
| Batch Task create | **Replace** | Reuse rapid multi-row entry concept inside Plan drafting; remove direct batch publication semantics |
| Direct counselor Task reschedule | **Replace** | Target movement happens in a new Plan Revision; historical/evidence-bearing intention remains immutable |
| Counselor profile/theme/password/sessions | **Keep** | Retain under More; use shared form/confirmation system |

### New Forms and Workflows

- **New requirement:** Daily Reality draft/block editor and publication review.
- **New requirement:** Counselor Plan draft, block/item editor, Curriculum picker, version diff, validation, and publication review.
- **New requirement:** Task Result with explicit outcome and labelled five-level learning quality.
- **New requirement:** Progress status/mastery/note workflow only after ADR-035 defines authority.
- **New requirement:** Practice, External Report, Internal Exam, Question moderation/rights/classification, Tickets, Suggestions, and private-note workflows.

## 8. Existing Design System

### Implemented Foundation

Both apps have local CSS variables, light/dark themes, shared-looking Button/Card/ContentState patterns, focus-visible outlines, reduced-motion handling, Persian/RTL document metadata, responsive shell layouts, and native system font fallbacks.

| Design-system area | Classification | Audit finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RTL foundation (`lang="fa"`, `dir="rtl"`, logical CSS properties) | **Keep** | Strong baseline; mixed LTR identifiers/times are handled selectively |
| Light/dark theme using `data-theme` and system preference | **Keep** | Separate local-storage keys by app are appropriate; full target contrast testing remains required |
| Focus-visible outline | **Keep** | Visible three-pixel focus base exists |
| Reduced-motion media query | **Keep** | Animation duration is reduced globally; future motion must continue to respect it |
| 44px minimum Button controls | **Keep** | Matches the target touch-control direction |
| Student green palette | **Replace** | Conflicts with approved blue-based Konkourix identity; green may remain a semantic success color rather than the primary brand |
| Counselor blue palette | **Modify** | Directionally aligned with target branding but not yet a shared approved token set |
| Gold `ک` brand mark and gradients | **Modify** | Provides identity but requires formal brand/icon/contrast review across roles and themes |
| Semantic tokens | **Modify** | Current tokens cover surface/text/accent/border/danger only; warning, success, info, selected, disabled, focus, overlays, charts, and domain/version states are partly hard-coded |
| Component implementation | **Modify** | Near-identical components/CSS are duplicated between apps; establish shared governance or synchronized package strategy before expansion |
| Typography | **Modify** | `Vazirmatn, IRANSans, system-ui` is declared but no font asset/import is evident; loading/fallback/metrics need a defined accessible strategy |
| Glass UI | **Keep** | Used sparingly only as mobile header blur; target correctly treats glass as optional |
| Card-heavy visual language | **Modify** | Comfortable and modern, but target workspaces need denser lists/grids/inspectors without turning every region into a large elevated Card |
| Icons | **Modify** | Code-native SVGs are efficient; expand into an accessible, consistent icon set without icon-only meaning |
| Form styling | **Modify** | Consistent local styling exists, but needs shared field, help, error, group, dialog, and validation patterns |
| Status colors | **Modify** | Pending/completed/skipped colors are hard-coded and domain-specific; centralize semantics and pair color with text/icons |
| Confirmation design | **Replace** | Browser `window.confirm` is not sufficient for target consequence, focus, audit, and responsive requirements |

### Product-Vision Fit

- **Keep:** Persian-first, calm, comfortable, role-specific language and separate student/counselor visual moods.
- **Modify:** Student green and task-list emphasis make the experience feel closer to a polished planner than the approved blue-based specialized Konkur ecosystem.
- **Replace:** Developer-facing phrases such as `نسخه پایه داشبورد`, milestone references, and disabled future-action placeholders should never be part of the target production experience.
- **New requirement:** Version/provenance, Curriculum, Progress, Practice/External/Internal, communication, and governance component semantics.

## 9. Responsive Behavior

### Implemented Behavior

| Behavior | Classification | Audit finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum viewport width 320px | **Keep** | Explicit baseline exists |
| Desktop 264px sticky sidebar | **Keep** | Stable role navigation foundation |
| Switch to mobile shell at 900px | **Keep** | Sidebar hides, sticky header and fixed bottom navigation appear |
| Safe-area bottom padding/navigation | **Keep** | Uses `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` and workspace padding |
| Mobile descriptions hidden in sticky header | **Modify** | Reduces clutter, but target context/version/student information must remain available |
| Student six-column mobile nav | **Replace** | Too many primary destinations and conflicts with target five-item navigation |
| Counselor five-column mobile nav | **Modify** | Capacity is right; destinations must change to Overview, Students, Planning, Inbox, More |
| Summary/dashboard grids collapse | **Keep** | Three/two columns become one at target breakpoints |
| Weekly seven-day grids | **Keep** | Seven desktop columns become two then one, avoiding forced tiny mobile columns |
| Drag-and-drop movement | **Keep** | Direct selection/destination-button alternative exists; drag is not the only method |
| Student subject workspace | **Keep** structurally | Two-panel layout collapses at 900px; interaction will be reused for canonical tree/detail, not student editing |
| Counselor student/task forms | **Modify** | Grids collapse correctly, but the very long Student Detail page needs target tabs/context and progressive disclosure |
| Auth split layout | **Keep** | Collapses to one column and shortens brand panel at 760px |
| Touch targets | **Keep** | Buttons and mobile-nav items meet the local 44px/58px targets |
| Orientation/zoom/high-contrast testing | **New requirement** | No explicit evidence from static source |
| Schedule list alternative | **New requirement** | Weekly cards reflow, but future time-based Plan/Reality grids require a true linear list/form alternative |
| Exam reconnect/offline responsive state | **New requirement** | No Internal Exam UI exists |

### Responsive Risks

- The current breakpoint-only approach is sufficient for small M19 pages but will not by itself manage a three-region counselor planning workspace or admin moderation inspectors.
- Fixed bottom navigation and sticky headers need keyboard/zoom testing to ensure they never obscure focused controls or validation.
- Native date/datetime controls mix RTL pages with LTR inputs; calendar, numeral, time-zone, and screen-reader behavior require real-device/browser validation.
- Student and Counselor page CSS is largely duplicated, increasing the risk of responsive fixes diverging.
- The current Student Detail page can become extremely long because weekly view, Task list, batch form, and single form are all rendered together.

## Target Gap Register

| Target capability | Current closest foundation | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student Today dashboard | `/planning` execution recovery plus placeholder `/` | **Replace** root; **Keep/Modify** execution modules |
| Counselor Overview | Placeholder `/` plus Students data | **Replace** |
| Canonical Curriculum Explorer | Editable Subject/Topic workspace | **Replace** |
| Student Progress | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Versioned counselor planning | Direct single/batch Task creation and reschedule | **Replace** |
| Daily Reality Schedule | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Task Result/five-level quality | Direct completed/skipped Task status | **Replace** |
| Study Session execution | `TaskExecutionPanel` and active-session cards | **Keep** |
| Practice Activity | Generic AssessmentAttempt form | **New requirement**; do not reuse lifecycle |
| External Exam Reports | Generic AssessmentAttempt form | **New requirement** |
| Internal Online Exams | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Question Bank admin | No admin app/UI | **New requirement** |
| General Chat | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Tickets/Threads | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Suggestions | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Private Counselor Notes | No UI | **New requirement** |
| Source-preserving Analytics | Placeholder Reports | **New requirement** |
| Admin architecture | No app/UI | **New requirement** |

## Recommended Preservation Boundaries

The following current UX behaviors should be preserved during future replacement work:

- server-authoritative active Study Session recovery;
- explicit confirmation that finishing study does not complete a Task;
- Task source labels distinguishing counselor and personal intention;
- evidence-aware locks before Task movement;
- drag plus non-drag weekly movement;
- localized loading/empty/error/success and retry behavior;
- role-separated Student and Counselor applications;
- relationship-scoped student list/detail access;
- Persian/RTL semantics, light/dark mode, visible focus, reduced motion, and safe-area mobile navigation;
- legacy AssessmentAttempt facts and invalidation history, presented explicitly as legacy evidence after target assessment separation.

The following current UX concepts must not guide the target architecture:

- student-authored subject/topic taxonomy;
- immediate counselor Task creation as the final planning model;
- direct checkbox-like completion as the final Task Result;
- one generic Assessment form for all testing activity;
- generic placeholder Dashboard/Reports destinations;
- exposing unfinished navigation with disabled controls;
- treating a long stacked student page as a scalable counselor workspace;
- treating duplicated local CSS/components as a complete design system.

## Implementation Sequence Implication

UI replacement must follow [ROADMAP_V2.md](ROADMAP_V2.md): Curriculum before Progress, Progress before Planning, Planning before Practice, Practice before Question Bank, Question Bank before Exams, and Exams before Analytics. The existing M19 surfaces remain compatibility UI until the corresponding target domain, migration, API, authorization, state recovery, accessibility, and exit criteria are complete.
