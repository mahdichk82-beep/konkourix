# Konkourix Implementation Roadmap V2

**Status:** Approved future implementation sequence; no implementation authorized by this document
**Last synchronized:** 2026-09-17
**Implementation baseline:** M19 (`76bc4d7`)
**Planning model:** Dependency-gated; no dates or effort commitments

This roadmap replaces the future implementation sequence in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The older file remains historical context; where the two differ, this document governs future ordering. Creating this roadmap does not authorize code, schema, migration, API, frontend, deployment, or data changes.

## Sources of Truth

- [PRODUCT_VISION.md](PRODUCT_VISION.md)
- [DOMAIN_MAP.md](DOMAIN_MAP.md)
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ADR-024 through ADR-032 in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)
- the standalone accepted ADRs in [adr/README.md](adr/README.md)
- [TARGET_DATABASE_DESIGN.md](database/TARGET_DATABASE_DESIGN.md)
- [UX_ARCHITECTURE.md](UX_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Mandatory Critical Path

```text
Curriculum
    -> Student Progress
        -> Counselor Planning
            -> Practice
                -> Question Bank
                    -> Exams
                        -> Analytics
```

Each arrow is a hard delivery gate. A later phase may be designed in more detail, but implementation must not begin until every earlier phase has met its exit criteria in the target environment. Partial backend completion, a hidden frontend, an experimental table, or incomplete migration verification does not count as phase completion.

Communication and counselor-ecosystem capabilities have their own supporting dependency lane after Planning. They do not weaken, bypass, or reorder the educational critical path.

## Phase Completion Standard

A phase is complete only when all of the following apply:

- required ADRs and unresolved policies for that phase are accepted;
- database evolution is additive, deployed, verified, observable, and reversible under the approved rollback plan;
- historical M19 records and current users continue to work;
- backend authorization and domain invariants are enforced independently of frontend visibility;
- API contracts and compatibility behavior are approved and tested;
- student, counselor, and admin surfaces required by the phase meet the target UX, RTL, responsive, state-recovery, and accessibility criteria;
- unit, integration, authorization, migration, contract, end-to-end, accessibility, and relevant performance/resilience tests pass;
- production-readiness evidence covers monitoring, support/recovery behavior, data reconciliation, and rollback;
- product/domain owners sign off against explicit exit criteria.

The next phase remains blocked if any required criterion is waived, deferred, or known to be false.

## 1. Current M19 Baseline

### Repository and Runtime

- pnpm monorepo;
- Fastify API in `apps/api`;
- independent React/TypeScript student and counselor applications in `apps/student-web` and `apps/counselor-web`;
- PostgreSQL with Prisma schema/migrations under `database/prisma`;
- current implementation checkpoint `76bc4d7` (`feat: add assessment attempt foundation`).

### Implemented Domain Foundation

| Domain | M19 implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Identity and access | Users, roles, sessions, student/counselor profiles, active/inactive counselor relationships |
| Transitional curriculum | Student-owned `StudySubject` and `Topic` with archive behavior |
| Planning | Student-owned `StudyPlan`; personal/counselor-attributed `DailyTask`; task lifecycle and planned test count |
| Execution | `StudySession` live, finish, cancellation/recovery, focus, study-quality feedback |
| Assessment | `AssessmentAttempt` completed aggregate counts/timing with soft invalidation |
| Goals | `StudentGoal` optionally linked to legacy subjects |
| Frontends | Student execution/planning/assessment foundations and counselor planning foundations |

### Not Implemented at M19

- Canonical Curriculum storage, governance, import, publication, or legacy mapping;
- Student Progress overlay;
- versioned counselor Plan drafts/publications or atomic Task materialization;
- Daily Reality Schedule;
- separate Task Result revisions and five-level task learning quality;
- Practice Activity domain;
- Question Bank;
- External Exam Report domain;
- Internal Online Exam delivery/evaluation;
- target Communication/Ticket/Suggestion modules;
- target reporting projections or advanced analytics.

M19 `StudySubject`, `Topic`, `StudyPlan`, `DailyTask`, `StudySession`, `AssessmentAttempt`, and `StudentGoal` records are preserved compatibility data. Their existence does not prove target-domain identity or justify inferred backfills.

## 2. Migration Strategy

### Expand, Verify, Cut Over, Retain

Every phase follows this pattern:

1. **Inventory:** record source counts, relationships, orphan conditions, and compatibility assumptions before change.
2. **Decide:** approve required ADRs, ownership, lifecycle, correction, rollback, and security policies.
3. **Expand:** add new structures and optional references without removing or changing current behavior.
4. **Populate deliberately:** import or backfill only when identity/provenance is proven; quarantine ambiguity.
5. **Dual read:** compose target and legacy data through explicit compatibility adapters where needed.
6. **Verify:** reconcile counts, sample histories, authorization, performance, idempotency, and failure recovery.
7. **Cut over writes:** move one approved workflow at a time to the target domain behind observable release controls.
8. **Cut over reads:** make target reads primary only after comparison and rollback evidence.
9. **Disable legacy writes:** only after all writers and recovery paths are proven.
10. **Retain history:** keep legacy rows and identifiers readable for historical resolution; physical removal requires a separate approved retention decision.

### Non-Negotiable Preservation Rules

- Never rewrite an applied migration.
- Never delete or reinterpret historical `StudySession` or `AssessmentAttempt` data.
- Never infer canonical identity from normalized names alone.
- Never invent plan publication, Question responses, provider identity, Task learning quality, mastery, or exam-delivery history.
- Never update an old curriculum reference to “latest.” Every target reference pins curriculum version and node.
- Never merge Practice, External Reports, and Internal Exams into one write model.
- Never use analytics projections as authoritative source records.
- Do not use uncontrolled dual writes. Any proposed dual write requires explicit atomicity, retry, reconciliation, and rollback semantics.

### Compatibility and Release Controls

- Target capabilities remain hidden until their database, API, authorization, UX, and recovery paths are ready.
- Feature/capability rollout may be cohort-based, but cohorts cannot observe partially published curriculum or plans.
- Backfills/imports are resumable and idempotent with immutable run reports.
- Each cutover defines measurable rollback boundaries and how target-era writes remain safe during rollback.
- Read projections retain source kind, source ID, curriculum version, and calculation version.
- Deprecation means “no new writes after verified cutover,” not “drop data.”

## 3. Future Phases Ordered by Dependency

## Phase 0 — Delivery Readiness and Decision Gates

### Goal

Turn the approved logical architecture into implementation-ready slices without changing runtime behavior. Establish the test, migration rehearsal, authorization, observability, rollout, and rollback standards used by every later phase.

### Domains Involved

Architecture governance, security, operations, testing, and compatibility planning across all domains.

### Database Impact

None. Physical schema proposals may be reviewed, but no schema or migration is created in this phase unless separately authorized as Phase 1 work.

### API Impact

None. Proposed contracts and compatibility/versioning rules are documentation artifacts only.

### Frontend Impact

None. Responsive prototypes and state models may be reviewed without modifying the applications.

### Migration Requirements

- inventory M19 tables, row counts, inbound references, orphan/quality conditions, and production-sized test fixtures;
- define backup, restore, reconciliation, rollback, and target-era-write handling;
- accept ADR-034 governance/permission requirements and the separate Curriculum legacy mapping/cutover policy before Phase 1 implementation begins;
- schedule ADR-035, ADR-040, and ADR-042 as hard gates for their respective later phases rather than guessing them early.

### Tests Required

- establish repeatable baseline application/database validation;
- prepare migration rehearsal and reconciliation test harnesses;
- define authorization, accessibility, performance, resilience, audit, and end-to-end acceptance matrices;
- verify a clean restore/recovery rehearsal process before any production data evolution.

### Exit Criteria

- Phase 1 scope and physical design are approved;
- ADR-034 is accepted and Curriculum import/mapping/cutover/rollback policies are accepted;
- M19 preservation inventory is signed off;
- release, observability, migration rehearsal, and rollback templates are ready;
- no unresolved Curriculum blocker is being delegated implicitly to implementation.

## Phase 1 — Canonical Curriculum Foundation

**Entry dependency:** Phase 0 complete.

### Goal

Deliver the controlled, versioned Canonical Curriculum foundation: exact Persian source preservation, stable node identity, imports/provenance, review/publication, cross-version lineage, and non-destructive M19 compatibility.

### Domains Involved

Canonical Curriculum, curriculum administration, legacy `StudySubject`/`Topic` compatibility, security/audit, and read-only Curriculum Explorer foundations.

### Database Impact

- add Curriculum Version, Node Type, logical Node, version-scoped Node Revision, Node Relationship, import/source/issue, mapping, and audit structures from the target database design;
- enforce version/node pair integrity, one canonical parent per version, deterministic sibling order, lifecycle, and immutable publication;
- add reviewed legacy mapping registry without changing legacy IDs/rows;
- retain published and superseded versions indefinitely for historical resolution.

### API Impact

- add version-aware published curriculum tree, path, node, search, and selection reads;
- add permission-scoped draft/import/review/validation/publication/mapping administration boundaries;
- preserve existing subject/topic contracts during compatibility;
- ensure clients cannot mutate Curriculum through consumer endpoints.

### Frontend Impact

- introduce role-appropriate read-only Curriculum Explorer foundations;
- add future admin Curriculum Operations for drafts, imports, ambiguity review, mappings, impact review, and publication;
- preserve exact Persian labels, source order, RTL hierarchy, missing-level behavior, retired/deprecated context, loading/error states, and accessible tree/list alternatives;
- do not expose target selection in operational workflows until their target writes are ready.

### Migration Requirements

- import the approved `cori.docx` transcription idempotently with checksum, exact labels, source order, and provenance;
- quarantine unresolved structures and prevent publication when blocking ambiguity remains;
- inventory and review `StudySubject`/`Topic` mappings without normalized-name-only matching;
- implement compatibility reads and rollback/reconciliation reports;
- do not disable legacy writes in this phase unless every existing workflow has an approved target replacement.

### Tests Required

- stable identity across compatible rename/reorder and new identity for semantic split/merge;
- hierarchy/type, cycle, parent, ordering, deprecation, lineage, and publication validation;
- import exactness, Unicode/source-label preservation, idempotency, ambiguity quarantine, and report reproducibility;
- published/superseded immutability and historical version resolution;
- curriculum-admin authorization and student/counselor read-only enforcement;
- legacy mapping ambiguity, compatibility reads, rollback, tree/search performance, RTL, keyboard, and screen-reader behavior.

### Exit Criteria

- at least one approved Curriculum Version is published atomically with retained source/import report;
- every published node has stable identity, type, parent/root state, order, and provenance;
- blocking ambiguities are resolved or explicitly excluded by authorized decision;
- old versions resolve and cannot be modified;
- reviewed legacy mappings distinguish confirmed, ambiguous, unmapped, and legacy-only records;
- M19 subject/topic workflows and historical reads still work;
- operational monitoring, reconciliation, backup, and rollback evidence is accepted.

## Phase 2 — Student Progress Overlay

**Entry dependency:** Phase 1 complete. ADR-035 accepted before implementation.

### Goal

Deliver student-specific learning state against exact published Curriculum references without changing Curriculum and without inferring mastery from M19 Tasks, sessions, or assessments.

### Domains Involved

Student Progress, Canonical Curriculum, Identity/Access, evidence provenance, Student App, and Counselor read access.

### Database Impact

- add version-pinned student-node Progress state and append-only Progress Event history;
- add evidence associations only according to ADR-035 and available source domains;
- enforce one current overlay per student/version/node and mastery range when known;
- preserve separate values for Progress mastery, Task learning quality, and Session quality.

### API Impact

- add version-aware student progress reads and permitted update/event commands;
- add counselor read access scoped to active relationships;
- expose source/evidence provenance without allowing Progress endpoints to mutate Curriculum or evidence;
- define cross-version reads according to approved mapping/continuity policy.

### Frontend Impact

- add Student Progress curriculum view, statuses, mastery, notes, review dates, strengths/weaknesses, and evidence history;
- add Counselor student-progress view within the student workspace;
- display unknown mastery as `Not rated`, never `0/5`;
- label version/mapping context and preserve accessible tree/list, empty, loading, partial, and error behavior.

### Migration Requirements

- create no mastery/status backfill from legacy Topic existence, Task completion, session ratings, or assessment counts;
- leave Progress empty/unknown until an authorized event establishes it;
- keep old-version Progress records intact when a new Curriculum Version publishes;
- rehearse cross-version mapping display without destructive transfer.

### Tests Required

- composite Curriculum reference and student ownership constraints;
- mastery/status validation and unknown-value behavior;
- append-only event history and correction/audit rules;
- student/counselor/admin authorization and relationship closure;
- no side effects from Tasks, Study Sessions, Practice, or assessments unless an approved evidence rule explicitly applies;
- historical-version display, mapping ambiguity, concurrency, accessibility, and performance over deep trees.

### Exit Criteria

- Progress state/history works end to end against exact Curriculum version/node pairs;
- authorized students and counselors see correct, isolated records;
- no current or historical Progress changes when Curriculum publishes a new version;
- no inferred mastery was introduced during migration;
- compatibility and reporting distinguish unknown, legacy activity, and explicit Progress;
- Phase 2 monitoring, reconciliation, accessibility, and rollback evidence is accepted.

## Phase 3 — Counselor Planning, Daily Reality, and Task Evolution

**Entry dependency:** Phase 2 complete. Planning lock-boundary, concurrency, reassignment, and Task-status cutover policies accepted.

### Goal

Deliver the target counselor planning loop: student-owned Daily Reality snapshots, editable counselor drafts, immutable published Plan Versions, atomic Task materialization, future-only revision, personal Tasks, separate Task Results, and preserved execution history.

### Domains Involved

Counselor Planning, Daily Reality Schedule, Tasks, Task Results, Study Sessions, Curriculum, Progress read context, student-counselor relationships, audit, Student App, and Counselor App.

### Database Impact

- add Daily Reality schedule/version/block structures;
- add Counselor Plan aggregate, draft revision, block/item lineage, immutable Plan Version/block/item, and Plan audit structures;
- add nullable version-pinned Curriculum and plan-item provenance to evolved `DailyTask` and `StudySession` during compatibility;
- add Task Result aggregate and immutable revisions with five-level learning quality;
- retain current `StudyPlan`, Task lifecycle fields, subject/topic references, and all sessions.

### API Impact

- add student-owned Daily Reality draft/publication and counselor read-only consumption;
- add counselor plan draft/edit/validate/diff/publish/revise/history commands with relationship and concurrency enforcement;
- make publication and Task materialization atomic and idempotent;
- add personal Task and Task Result flows that protect counselor-authored fields;
- preserve M19 Task/Plan/Session contracts through explicit compatibility behavior while target clients transition.

### Frontend Impact

- implement the target Counselor planning workspace, reality overlay, curriculum picker, workload editor, version diff, validation, publication, and history;
- implement Student published-plan, source-labelled counselor/personal Tasks, Plan history, Daily Reality editor, and Task Result workflow;
- clearly separate Plan intention, Study Session, Task Result, Practice entry point, and Progress;
- support mobile direct-entry/list alternatives, desktop paper-speed planning, Persian/RTL, keyboard, accessible time editing, and all recovery states.

### Migration Requirements

- do not synthesize Plan Versions or publication events for current `StudyPlan` or counselor-created Tasks;
- preserve every existing personal/counselor Task and its provenance as standalone legacy intention;
- add target references as nullable, backfilling only confirmed Curriculum mappings;
- represent legacy completed Task quality as unknown and retain existing skip facts;
- never copy `StudySession.studyQualityRating` to Task Result;
- disable legacy planning writes only after target student and counselor workflows, reads, and rollback are proven.

### Tests Required

- relationship authorization, student/counselor field ownership, private-data isolation, and reassignment behavior;
- draft concurrency, no silent last-write-wins, validation, publication atomicity/idempotency, and partial-failure rollback;
- immutable published versions and evidence-bearing historical Tasks;
- correct retain/supersede/replace Task materialization across future revisions;
- Daily Reality student ownership, counselor read-only access, snapshot pinning, time-zone/range validation, and privacy;
- five-level Task Result requirements, skip behavior, correction history, and separation from Session/Progress;
- M19 compatibility, migration reconciliation, end-to-end responsive/RTL/accessibility, and planning performance.

### Exit Criteria

- counselor can draft, validate, publish, and revise future plans end to end;
- student sees an atomic published version and correct materialized Tasks;
- historical published intention and all execution/result evidence remain unchanged after revision;
- student can publish Daily Reality and counselors can only consume the pinned snapshot;
- personal Tasks remain visibly and technically distinct;
- Task Result and Study Session facts remain separate with no automatic Progress mutation;
- M19 Tasks, Plans, Sessions, and historical reads remain operational;
- migration, monitoring, reconciliation, rollback, UX, and accessibility acceptance is complete.

## Phase 4 — Practice Activity

**Entry dependency:** Phase 3 complete. ADR-040 accepted before any legacy-assessment classification or cutover behavior is implemented.

### Goal

Deliver daily Practice as its own learning/evidence lifecycle, optionally connected to a Task or Study Session, without exam-delivery semantics and without reclassifying M19 `AssessmentAttempt` rows by inference.

### Domains Involved

Practice Activity, Tasks, Study Sessions, Curriculum, Student Progress evidence integration when ADR-035 permits it, legacy assessment compatibility, Student App, and Counselor evidence review.

### Database Impact

- add Practice aggregate, immutable revision, Curriculum target, and optional governed Question-response structures;
- support aggregate source/count/time evidence without requiring Question Bank items;
- retain optional Task/Session provenance without manufacturing either record;
- leave `AssessmentAttempt` unchanged as generic legacy completed evidence unless ADR-040 explicitly says otherwise.

### API Impact

- add Practice draft/record/correct/invalidate and history reads;
- validate student ownership, exact Curriculum pairs, source attribution, count invariants, and optional Task/Session compatibility;
- add counselor read access scoped to active relationships;
- expose no exam eligibility, secure delivery, timer, or authoritative scoring lifecycle.

### Frontend Impact

- add the explicit chooser separating Practice, External Exam Report, and Konkourix Online Exam;
- add low-friction Task-linked or independent Practice capture with source, Curriculum, time if known, and aggregate counts;
- show recorded revision, correction/invalidation history, and provenance;
- preserve `Legacy assessment` labelling for M19 attempts rather than relabelling them as Practice.

### Migration Requirements

- perform no bulk conversion based on title, counts, Task link, legacy Subject/Topic, or timing;
- keep existing assessment APIs/history active through compatibility;
- add canonical references only to new Practice writes or explicitly confirmed mappings;
- introduce Question-level responses later when published Question Versions exist, without making them required for aggregate Practice.

### Tests Required

- draft/record/correct/invalidate lifecycle and immutable revision history;
- non-negative/reconciled counts and exact version-pinned Curriculum validation;
- student ownership and counselor relationship-scoped reads;
- optional Task/Session provenance and no fake Task/Session creation;
- no automatic Task Result or Progress mutation;
- no Internal Exam states or External provider semantics;
- M19 legacy evidence compatibility, idempotency, migration rollback, accessibility, RTL, and mobile entry recovery.

### Exit Criteria

- students can record aggregate Practice independently or from eligible Tasks without a fake Study Session;
- counselors can review Practice without editing student evidence;
- recorded/corrected/invalidated history is reproducible;
- no M19 attempt was reclassified without the approved ADR-040 process;
- Practice remains separate from External Reports and Internal Exams in storage, APIs, UI language, and tests;
- Phase 4 reconciliation, observability, rollback, UX, and accessibility evidence is accepted.

## Phase 5 — Question Bank Foundation

**Entry dependency:** Phase 4 complete. Question media/storage and operational rights-review policies accepted.

### Goal

Deliver a governed, rights-aware, versioned Question Bank with moderated multi-node Curriculum classification for future governed Practice and Internal Exams.

### Domains Involved

Question Bank, Canonical Curriculum, attribution/rights, moderation/audit, admin identity/permissions, governed Practice integration, and future Internal Exams.

### Database Impact

- add stable Question identity and immutable Question Version structures;
- add format-specific answer/option structures, attribution, rights, Curriculum tags, and moderation events;
- enforce one or more version-pinned Curriculum tags and exactly one primary tag for published versions;
- retain withdrawn/retired content needed by historical Practice/Exam evidence;
- add approved media references only after secure object-storage design.

### API Impact

- add permission-separated submission, edit-draft, educational review, answer/solution verification, rights review, Curriculum review, approval, publication, withdrawal, and history operations;
- add student/counselor consumption endpoints only for eligible published Question Versions;
- protect answer keys, solutions, unpublished content, rights evidence, and moderation data;
- ensure logical Question IDs alone are insufficient for delivery—consumers pin exact versions.

### Frontend Impact

- implement future role-scoped Question Bank admin workspaces, queues, editor, attribution/rights panels, Curriculum tagging, review checklist, preview, publication, and withdrawal;
- require exactly one primary most-specific defensible Curriculum tag without inventing missing atomic nodes;
- show derived ancestors as context rather than editable authoritative tags;
- add governed Question Bank Practice consumption only after publication and entitlement rules are enforced.

### Migration Requirements

- there is no M19 question table to convert;
- seed/import/partner content enters through source, rights, moderation, and Curriculum workflows rather than direct publication;
- preserve source artifacts and deduplication decisions without identity-by-normalized-text;
- do not create item-level responses for aggregate legacy Practice/Assessment history.

### Tests Required

- stable logical identity, version creation, published immutability, withdrawal/retirement, and historical resolution;
- moderation transition/capability separation and full audit history;
- attribution and rights publication gates, expiry/dispute/revocation effects, and restricted evidence access;
- multi-node tags, exactly one primary, pinned Curriculum version, derived ancestry, and classification-version correction;
- answer-key/solution confidentiality, rich-content sanitization, media scanning/access, and unauthorized enumeration protection;
- search/filter performance, Persian/RTL content, preview fidelity, accessibility, and integration with governed Practice.

### Exit Criteria

- authorized staff can take a Question Version from submission through every required review to atomic publication;
- no Question Version publishes without verified answer/solution, attribution, usable rights basis, and valid Curriculum classification;
- published versions are immutable and precisely consumable; withdrawal blocks new use without corrupting history;
- student/counselor users cannot access protected drafts, rights evidence, or unreleased answers;
- a production-ready set of approved Question Versions is available for Internal Exam validation;
- monitoring, audit, security, performance, rollback, UX, and accessibility acceptance is complete.

## Phase 6 — External Reports and Internal Online Exams

**Entry dependency:** Phase 5 complete. ADR-042, secure evidence storage, and Internal Exam attempt/scoring/release policies accepted.

This phase has two separate delivery slices. They may share reporting later, but they never share a write lifecycle. Internal Exam implementation cannot begin until the Question Bank exit criteria are met. External Report implementation also waits until this phase to preserve the mandated critical-path order.

### Goal

Deliver provider-owned External Exam reporting and Konkourix-owned Internal Online Exam authoring, eligibility, secure delivery, answer capture, evaluation, and reproducible results as separate domains.

### Domains Involved

- **External slice:** provider registry, External Exam Reports, evidence files, structured section results, counselor review, Curriculum.
- **Internal slice:** Question Bank, Exam builder/versioning, eligibility, Attempt delivery, answers, evaluation/manual review, results, Curriculum, security/audit.
- **Shared read concern:** legacy `AssessmentAttempt` compatibility and source-preserving assessment history.

### Database Impact

- add External provider, report aggregate/revisions, section results, evidence metadata, and counselor review structures;
- add stable Internal Exam, immutable Exam Version/Section/Item, eligibility, Attempt, delivered-item snapshot, Answer, Attempt Event, Evaluation/Item Evaluation, and Result structures;
- pin exact Curriculum, Question, and Exam Versions;
- preserve `AssessmentAttempt` unchanged and represent any unified history as a read projection.

### API Impact

- add External Report draft/record/correct/invalidate, evidence upload/scan status, structured result, history, and counselor review operations according to ADR-042;
- add Internal Exam author/review/publish, eligibility, start/resume, answer-save, submit, expire/terminate/invalidate, automatic/manual evaluation, result-release, and correction operations;
- use server-authoritative time, state, ownership, idempotency, and delivery snapshots;
- maintain separate route/domain contracts and do not route External Reports through Internal Exam Attempt endpoints.

### Frontend Impact

- implement Student External Report entry, evidence status, exact provider facts, correction/invalidation, and counselor-review experience;
- implement Internal Exam discovery/eligibility, preflight, server-timed attempt, accessible question navigation, save/reconnect, explicit submission, evaluation status, and result history;
- implement admin Exam builder/version publication, eligibility/delivery operations, manual evaluation, correction/invalidation, and audit views;
- retain the three-way Practice/External/Internal chooser and clearly labelled legacy assessment history.

### Migration Requirements

- create no External provider/report or Internal Exam/Attempt from an M19 title/count heuristic;
- follow ADR-040 for any approved legacy classification while retaining original rows and IDs;
- follow ADR-042 for provider identity, normalization, import, correction, and evidence retention;
- validate object-storage quarantine/retention and rollback without orphaning report revisions;
- preserve exact Question/Exam delivery snapshots and scoring specifications indefinitely where results depend on them.

### Tests Required

- External provider governance, report revisions, evidence upload validation/scanning/access, counselor review separation, and no Internal lifecycle leakage;
- immutable Exam Version/Question Version selection and publication validation;
- eligibility, ownership, attempt allowance, state-machine transitions, server timer/deadline, reconnect/resume, idempotent answer save/submission, expiry, and duplicate/replay resistance;
- realized item/option order stability and result reproducibility;
- objective scoring, manual review, finalized Evaluation immutability, re-evaluation/result supersession, and release policy;
- answer-key confidentiality, authorization, rate/abuse protection, audit integrity, accessibility under time pressure, RTL, responsive recovery, load/performance, and failure resilience;
- no automatic Study Session, Task Result, or Progress mutation.

### Exit Criteria

- External Report evidence can be recorded, corrected, invalidated, reviewed, and resolved without provider/internal-exam conflation;
- an authorized Internal Exam can be built from published Question Versions and published immutably;
- an eligible student can start, reconnect, answer, submit, and receive a reproducible result under server-authoritative state/time;
- manual evaluation and correction produce immutable, auditable revisions;
- protected content and other students' attempts/results remain isolated;
- M19 `AssessmentAttempt` history remains visible and unchanged;
- security, performance, resilience, monitoring, migration, rollback, UX, and accessibility acceptance is complete.

## Phase 7 — Reporting and Analytics

**Entry dependency:** Phase 6 complete. Reporting calculation/versioning, freshness, retention, and access policies accepted.

### Goal

Deliver trustworthy cross-domain reporting and explainable improvement views over authoritative source facts. This phase does not authorize AI diagnosis, ranking, or an opaque analytics platform.

### Domains Involved

Curriculum, Progress, Planning, Tasks/Results, Study Sessions, Practice, External Reports, Internal Exam Results, legacy assessment evidence, reporting projections, Student App, and Counselor App.

### Database Impact

- add/rebuild source-preserving views or projections for student learning timeline, Curriculum progress reports, Plan execution comparison, and assessment evidence timeline;
- add projection checkpoint/freshness metadata only if asynchronous materialization is necessary;
- retain source kind/ID, Curriculum version, and calculation version in materialized metrics;
- do not copy source facts into a new authoritative generic activity table.

### API Impact

- add permission-scoped report queries with explicit period, source coverage, freshness, calculation version, and partial-data semantics;
- expose drill-down from summaries to authorized source facts;
- preserve source-specific units and refuse unsupported cross-provider/exam normalization;
- make projection rebuild/failure invisible to source write correctness.

### Frontend Impact

- implement student progress/momentum views that explain their evidence and support improvement without shame, rank, or diagnosis;
- implement counselor Plan-versus-execution, learning timeline, Curriculum evidence, and assessment-source views;
- show legacy, missing, partial, stale, invalidated, corrected, and version-mapped data explicitly;
- provide accessible text/table equivalents for every chart and retain source drill-down.

### Migration Requirements

- build projections from immutable source facts in resumable/rebuildable jobs;
- include M19 records under explicit legacy source kinds without synthetic classification;
- validate old Curriculum versions and mappings during historical rollup;
- run shadow comparisons and reconciliation before making target reports primary;
- rollback by disabling/rebuilding projections, never by changing source records.

### Tests Required

- deterministic calculation and calculation-version reproducibility;
- source inclusion/exclusion, invalidation/correction, time-zone/date-boundary, Curriculum-version rollup, and legacy handling;
- projection idempotency, ordering, rebuild, lag/freshness, partial failure, and reconciliation;
- student/counselor/admin authorization and source drill-down isolation;
- large-data performance, accessible charts/tables, responsive layouts, RTL, empty/loading/partial/error states;
- assertions that report/API actions cannot mutate source domains.

### Exit Criteria

- every reported value can identify its source facts, time range, Curriculum/calculation version, and freshness;
- projection rebuilds reproduce accepted results and reconcile against source counts;
- students and counselors receive role-appropriate, accessible, non-shaming views;
- legacy/partial data is disclosed and not presented as complete or normalized;
- reporting cannot mutate Planning, Progress, Practice, Exam, or Communication facts;
- monitoring, support, rollback, performance, UX, and accessibility acceptance is complete.

## Supporting Lane A — Communication and Counselor Ecosystem

**Entry dependency:** Phase 3 complete plus acceptance of retention, moderation, attachment, notification, relationship, and private-note policies. This lane may not consume capacity or shared contracts in a way that bypasses the critical-path gates.

### Goal

Deliver separate General Chat, Ticket/Thread, and Suggestion workflows; human-reviewed counselor acquisition; and confidential private counselor notes without creating entity-specific chat or weakening domain ownership.

### Domains Involved

Communication, Tickets, Suggestions, student-counselor relationships/acquisition, private counselor notes, security/audit, Student App, Counselor App, and future admin workspaces.

### Database Impact

- add relationship-scoped conversation/messages, Tickets/participants/messages/status events, Suggestions/events, and typed contextual links;
- add invitation/request/introduction/selection lifecycle structures only after exact counselor-acquisition policy is approved;
- add separately protected private note and note-access audit structures;
- do not store plan/result/curriculum mutations in communication records.

### API Impact

- add separate contracts and authorization for Chat, Tickets, Suggestions, acquisition transitions, and private notes;
- validate contextual targets without transferring ownership to Communication;
- ensure relationship closure, exceptional admin access, retention, and notification behavior follow approved policy;
- keep private notes outside student-visible and unified-inbox APIs.

### Frontend Impact

- add unified inbox projection with visibly separate Chat/Ticket/Suggestion modes;
- add structured Ticket status/history and governed Suggestion review feedback;
- add free registration, invitation, human-reviewed introduction, and student final-selection UX without automatic matching;
- add separately protected Counselor private-note area and authorized admin oversight, never Student access.

### Migration Requirements

- no M19 Task, plan, note-like text, or activity is converted to Chat/Ticket/Suggestion/private note;
- preserve current `StudentCounselor` relationships and add acquisition history only for future transitions;
- do not fabricate invitation, request, review, or consent events for current active relationships.

### Tests Required

- relationship/participant authorization, closure/reassignment, contextual-link validation, notification privacy, retention, and abuse controls;
- separate Chat, Ticket, Suggestion, and private-note lifecycle and visibility tests;
- human-review/no-automatic-matching acquisition invariants and student final selection;
- private-note read/export/exceptional-access audit and non-transfer on reassignment;
- accessibility, RTL, pagination/order, idempotent send/retry, offline/error recovery, and load behavior.

### Exit Criteria

- each communication mode works end to end without becoming authoritative domain state;
- no entity-specific chat proliferation exists;
- counselor acquisition is explicit, human-reviewed, and student-selected;
- private notes are inaccessible to students and unauthorized counselors, with audited exceptional access;
- current relationships remain valid without synthetic acquisition history;
- security, retention, monitoring, rollback, UX, and accessibility acceptance is complete.

## Phase Gate Register

| Gate | Required before | Decision/evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADR-034 | Phase 1 | Curriculum governance, administrative capabilities, separation of duties, and audit |
| Curriculum migration policy gate | Phase 1 | Legacy Curriculum mapping, cutover, reconciliation, and rollback |
| ADR-035 | Phase 2 | Progress actor authority, evidence acceptance, mastery calculation, cross-version continuity |
| Planning policy gate | Phase 3 | Future/historical lock boundary, reassignment, concurrency, Task status authority |
| ADR-040 | Phase 4 and Phase 6 migration behavior | Long-term role and safe classification policy for `AssessmentAttempt` |
| Media/storage gate | Phase 5 and Phase 6 | Secure object storage, scanning, access, retention, deletion |
| ADR-042 | Phase 6 | External provider identity, normalization, correction/import, legacy compatibility |
| Internal Exam policy gate | Phase 6 | Retakes, accommodations, timing, appeals, scoring, manual review, release, proctoring/offline boundaries |
| Reporting policy gate | Phase 7 | Calculation versions, freshness, retention, access, partial-data semantics |
| Communication policy gate | Supporting Lane A | Attachments, edit/delete, moderation, abuse, notification, retention, relationship/acquisition rules |

An unresolved gate blocks the affected phase or slice. It is not permission to choose a convenient implementation default.

## Explicitly Deferred Beyond Roadmap V2

The following have no implementation phase in this roadmap:

- AI analysis or recommendations;
- student ranking or competitive leaderboards;
- live or recorded classes/content platform;
- school/organization management;
- subscriptions, billing, or marketplace;
- post-exam ecosystem services.

These directions require new product decisions, ADRs, domain/data/API/UX design, security review, and a revised dependency roadmap. They must not be inserted opportunistically into the phases above.

## Roadmap Change Control

- Phase ordering may change only through an explicit approved architecture decision that explains dependency, migration, and compatibility effects.
- Phase scope may be split into smaller release slices, but no slice may bypass its entry dependency or weaken its exit criteria.
- A feature being technically hidden does not permit premature schema or write-path implementation.
- Documentation, prototypes, and test design may proceed ahead for discovery; production implementation and data mutation may not.
- Completion status must cite verifiable code, migration, test, reconciliation, operational, UX, and accessibility evidence rather than roadmap prose.
